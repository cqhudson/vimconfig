# .vimrc config file

To use the config, either download the repo and place the `.vimrc` file into your home directory, or add it's contents to your own .vimrc file.

- The config should be located at `~\.vimrc`. This translates to `C:\Users\Name` on Windows systems. So on a Windows machine you would save your .vimrc file to `C:\Users\Name\.vimrc`
